Framework vs Library:

Framework - more rigid code w/ functionality 
Library - little pieces to add on existing code base
Jquery - used for DOM manipualtion when there is a user action (events). 
if you want to check for Jquery type " $=== jquery" and it should it equal true or just type jquery ( if it doesnt exist it will throw a reference error)

Refresher:
document.getElementbyId
In jquery to get elements by tag name:
$('div')
$$('div') this will get all

Difference between HTMLcollection vs Array:

Ex. Iterate all the divs on the page and console.log the innerText for each div

var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div')
for(var i = 0; i< div.length ; i++){
console.log(divs[i].innerText)
}


divs.forEach(function(element)){
console.log(element)
}
this will not work because forEach is undefined. 

Finding things in the DOM:
getById, getByTagName, getByClassName, querySelector

jquery has one function for selecting things:
$ - jquery

inside the dollar sign you input what you want to select. you can use your CSS properties:
Ex. $('div')
to get the first div
Ex. $('div').eq(0)
this is returns a jquery object. you can chain methods to return consist list of jquery objects
Ex. $('div')[0]
this returns a HTML object

ID's trump Class Names because of weighting.
